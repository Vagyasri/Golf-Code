# Golf-Code
- In the game of golf, each hole has a `par`, meaning, the average number of `strokes` a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below `par` your `strokes` are, there is a different nickname.

- `par` and `strokes` will always be numeric and positive. 

- I have written a function, that will be passed `par` and `strokes` arguments and will return the correct string according to this table which lists the `strokes` in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):
